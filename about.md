## About us

We are a group of London cyclists committed to finding the best gear for bicycle commuting.

Our views are heavily influenced by [Just Ride: A Radically Practical Guide to Bikes, Equipment, Health, Safety, and Attitude](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0761155589/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0761155589&linkCode=as2&tag=londoncycling-21&linkId=8adc3c4d996102aa1ff9725eb0d0b27c)![](http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=londoncycling-21&l=am2&o=2&a=0761155589 =1x1).

We think cycle commuting should be about enjoying the fresh air, whilst moving through traffic safely and elegantly. We think you should use high quality, reliable gear to get you where you are going without frustration.

If we had to summarise our philosophy in one sentence – we would point you to this gem from our aforementioned favourite cycling book:

> A bicycle should make your life better, not take it over and boss you around.
