We are a group of London cyclists committed to finding the best gear for bicycle commuting. So what is this blog about?

We think cycle commuting should be about enjoying the fresh air, whilst moving through traffic safely and elegantly. We think you should use high quality, reliable gear to get you where you are going without frustration.

Our views are heavily influenced by [Just Ride: A Radically Practical Guide to Bikes, Equipment, Health, Safety, and Attitude](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0761155589/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0761155589&linkCode=as2&tag=londoncycling-21&linkId=8adc3c4d996102aa1ff9725eb0d0b27c).

If we had to summarise our philosophy in one sentence – we would point you to this gem from our aforementioned favourite cycling book:

> A bicycle should make your life better, not take it over and boss you around.

## So… what’s coming up?

Good question. We’re going to share the best (and worst!) gear we try out. We want to save you time and help you buy the best gear out there. Expect posts on:

* Cycling cameras
* Cycling mindset
* Bicycle luggage
* Part reviews
* Local cycle shops
* Rain gear – because this is a London based blog after all…
